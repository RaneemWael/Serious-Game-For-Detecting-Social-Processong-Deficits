# Serious-Game-For-Detecting-Social-Processong-Deficits
This game was created using Unity and C# to detect social processing deficits in people through a gamified experience. Find it at this link: https://raneemwael.itch.io/serious-game-social-deficits

## Description:

Social connections are an important part of human life. People who suffer from social processing deficits such as social anxiety and impeded adaptive learning cannot  perform properly in social situations. They also function poorly in social situations that revolve around trust and tend to make bad judgement calls. Therefore, the aim is to create a serious game that can test the performance of people, possibly detecting social processing deficits.

Using a decision based making game, where the player walks through a forest and is encountered by situations where they are required to make a decision upon, we collect data and by analysing them, can detect what social processing deficits the player might have.

It was built as a webGL using Unity.
